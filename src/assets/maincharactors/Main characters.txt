## Vrael Character In-Depth Setting

### I. Basic Information
**Height, Weight, Body Proportions**  
Vrael is a giant over 200 cm tall, with an extremely burly and robust build, classified as super heavyweight. His broad shoulders and powerful muscles exude overwhelming physical presence as both a king and warrior.

**Skin Color, Hair Color and Style, Eye Color and Shape**  
Appearance: Dark hair reaching shoulders, dense beard, rugged style. Skin weathered from years of battle.  
Eyes: Deep sockets burning with ominous dark red "embers." When primal instincts rage, they turn pure crimson; after becoming the "Bearer" and carrying sins, they become heavy like "two blood-soaked, cooled embers."

**Posture Features**  
Posture: Like a "silent, watchful statue" at borders, showing kingly and guardian steadiness. Staggers when in inner pain or facing dilemmas.  
Action Habits: Slowly wipes blade with rough cloth after battle as a ritual to detach from killing. Starts large-scale power with primal "war dance." Kneels on both knees for repentance or deep respect.

**Voice**  
Tone and Intonation: Low, hoarse, with kingly gravity. After becoming "Bearer" and awakening **Poet's Throat**, it becomes "clearer, more resonant, yet heavier."

**First Impression / Others' Perception**  
First impression: Massive oppression combined with deep tragedy. Embodiment of pure power, but eyes and posture reveal endless fatigue and pain, evoking a "king bearing the world's fate."

### II. Psychological Structure and Motivations
**Core Values / Life Beliefs**  
Early: Dreamed of being a poet.  
Mid: After founding the Silent Nation, protecting family (Rei, Annelise, children) became his anchor against inner chaos.  
Late (Bearer): After killing Leo and inheriting memories, beliefs evolve to **redemption and bearing**. No longer seeks personal glory or poetry; bears others' sins and memories, viewing "not killing" as requiring greater willpower than killing.

**Deepest Fears / Traumas**  
Trauma: Killing Leo and his team is his deepest, unforgivable wound, becoming an "unrefusable heavy legacy" and eternal shackle.  
Fear: As a short-lived hybrid, fears "being forgotten," especially vanishing from children's memories as an irrelevant verse.

**Desires Understanding from Whom, But Unwilling to Admit**  
Deeply craves understanding from Annelise and Rei, leading to confessing sins to avoid love based on "the basest lie I wove." Kingly pride makes him hide vulnerability, facing everything in silence.

**Behavior Under Pressure**  
Breakdown/Loss of Control: Under extreme mental stress (e.g., phantom attacks), "graÅfthekk" predatory instinct awakens, turning him into a killing beast. Cries like a mortal father under family emotional shocks.  
Escape/Self-Destruction: After grave errors, self-exiles into endless battles to numb pain?a disguised self-destruction.  
Calm: As king in war, shows supreme commander's absolute calm and decisiveness.

**Does He Lie? To Whom? Why?**  
Lied with Rei and Shiori to the entire Silent Nation?including Annelise?about Leo's death. Motive: Protect fragile trust and stability at alliance's start, maintain leader image.

### III. Language and Behavioral Traits
**Speaking Style**  
As poet, language full of metaphors and weight. After **Poet's Throat**, voice gains penetration and resonance. As king, commands are concise and authoritative.

**Typical Phrases**  
"I am?the speaker who chooses not to kill."  
"I refuse to be forgotten like this!!!!"  
"This is my inheritance to you, Kael. Power to protect, and... responsibility to destroy."  
Before final battle: "Fight!!!!!"

**Common Gestures or Habits**  
Post-battle blade wiping is signature ritual. War dance for large power.  

**Action Speed**  
Dual: Battle speed like "black lightning"; thoughtful or watchful like "statue," motionless for long. Impulsive when emotions (especially instincts) override reason.

### IV. Emotions and Interpersonal Patterns
**Trust Starting Point and Boundaries**  
Trust built on shared battles and honesty. Deepest with family, unable to tolerate lies long. With Grell, Shiori allies: forged through life-death trials and respect for strength.

**View on Love**  
Complex, tragic. With Rei and Annelise (mother-daughter), forms transcendent "divine family" and "blood covenant." Deep love and responsibility tied to guilt over Leo's death.

**Relations to Family, Clan, or Past**  
Family is final defense and anchor against chaos. Deep, sometimes clumsy fatherly love for children; anxious about not seeing them grow. Profound self-loathing post-Leo killing.

**How Misunderstood? How He Views It?**  
Before truth reveal, Annelise saw him as perfect tragic hero?a tormenting "perfect misunderstanding." Indifferent to others' misconceptions but can't bear family's, driving confession.

### V. Lifestyle Details and Preferences
**Favorite Foods / Disliked Tastes**

But their songs are my only dawn light.  
May this remnant body become guardian wall,  
For their brief, weary peace.  
I burn all, for this is my fate?  
In ashes, illuminate dawn for them.
